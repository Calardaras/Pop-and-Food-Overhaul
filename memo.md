to do 

province value
    total_food_income
localization
    FOOD_INCOME_TT


I want to make a mod for pop-based food output and the food output penalties that come with levies.
It seems from my testing that I can only do one operation at a time with change_variable. I'd like to try and see if I can tighten it up a bit with formulas.
